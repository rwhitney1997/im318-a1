        <p> Speaking of making history, very few games have had the cultural impact that the release of Baldur's Gate 3 did. An insane amount of effort, time, and love went in to recreating the Dungeons and Dragons world of Baldur's Gate, and the 300 hours it takes to complete on average speaks volumes. Genuinely such an impressive and mindblowing piece of art, and certainly a must-play. </p>
